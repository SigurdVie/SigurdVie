## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sigurd Vie, also commonly known as MrCenny on the interwebs.

I do not code that often, and only code as a hobby and to challange my thinking juices.

I come from the middle of Norway, aka. TrÃ¸ndelag.

I am a tad bit knowledgable about GoHUGO, but would no call myself a professional in the craft of static websitemaking.

Projects I am currently helping on are:
 - [Fedihosting Foundation's Main Page](https://fedihosting.foundation)
